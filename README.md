# Todos
I'm implementing the same exact backend for a todo application in three languages:-
- [x] Go
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Typescript

My goal is to find out how the developer experience is when using them and if and why they are best suited for writing backend servers.
The backend being implemented has quite a lot going on:-
- It uses **Sqlite** for storing data
- **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE** routes
- Implement **cookie-based authentication** from scratch in all languages
